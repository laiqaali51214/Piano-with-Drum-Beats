  This project is a Python-based piano simulator built with pygame and other libraries. It allows users to play virtual piano keys using their keyboard or mouse, with various functionalities like:

*  Colors of button: black keys are shown in dark blue and white keys are shown in light blue.
*  Playing notes: Pressing keys or clicking on dark black and white blue keys triggers corresponding piano sounds.
* Octave switching: Use arrow keys to switch between octaves for a wider range of notes.
* Visual feedback: Active keys have corresponding alphabets written on them for better understanding of played notes.
* Song playback: Play pre-recorded songs like "Anthem" and "Believer" by clicking dedicated buttons.
* Drum accompaniment: The simulator plays background drums while notes are played. You can pause the drums with the spacebar.

### Getting Started

1. Install requirements: Make sure you have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:
    * pygame
    * matplotlib
    * keys (custom library provided in the project)
2. Run the script: Open a terminal in the project directory and run python piano.py.
3. Start playing: Press keys or click piano keys to play notes. Use arrow keys to switch octaves and the spacebar to pause drums.

### Features

* 52 white keys and 36 black keys: Covers a wide range of notes for playing different musical pieces.
* Realistic piano sounds: Each key triggers a corresponding high-quality piano sound for an immersive experience.
