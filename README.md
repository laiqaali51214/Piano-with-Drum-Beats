# Piano-with-Drum-Beats
## Piano Project Overview
  This project offers a virtual musical experience by simulating a piano and drums interface on a computer. Users can interact with a virtual piano keyboard using their computer's keyboard keys and play accompanying drum beats, creating a fusion of melodies and rhythms.

  This project is a Python-based piano simulator built with pygame and other libraries. It allows users to play virtual piano keys using their keyboard or mouse, with various functionalities like:

*  Colors of button: black keys are shown in dark blue and white keys are shown in light blue.
*  Playing notes: Pressing keys or clicking on dark black and white blue keys triggers corresponding piano sounds.
* Octave switching: Use arrow keys to switch between octaves for a wider range of notes.
* Visual feedback: Active keys have corresponding alphabets written on them for better understanding of played notes.
* Song playback: Play pre-recorded songs like "Anthem" and "Believer" by clicking dedicated buttons.
* Drum accompaniment: The simulator plays background drums while notes are played. You can pause the drums with the spacebar.
